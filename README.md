# Liar's Poker is a card game which is based on prediction and bluffing.
The game used with a normal deck of cards and at the first round all players are given two cards.
The player, who lost the round, is given one more card at the next round.
If a player had reached five cards and lost another round, he does not take one more card but no cards and plays the next round as blind
If a blind player lose a round, the player is eliminated.
The last player standing in game wins!
# Round rules:
1-) First player makes a guess.
<br/>
2-) Second player has two choices: She/He can claim that the last guess made is false and open all cards of players or make a new guess which is higher than the last guess.
<br/>
3-) When a player opens the cards the round ends and the cards are counted and if the last guess is right then the last player loses the round, else the one who made the last guess lose the round.
# Guess rules:
1-) Every guess has a compulsory base part. Which claims that there are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 cards of a specific value in cards of all players.
<br/>
2-) If the base part of a guess is 3, 5 or 7, it has an optional secondary part which claims additional to the base part that there are respectively 2,3 or 5 cards of a specific value in cards of all players.
<br/>
3-) All guesses have a specific height. The guess with bigger base part is higher. If the base parts are equal, the one with secondary part is higher.
